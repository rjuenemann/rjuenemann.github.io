I am a fourth-year Computational and Mathematical Engineering PhD Candidate at Stanford University. I am working in Prof. Markus Covert's group on whole-cell modeling of _E. coli_, adapting the model to answer new questions in genetic and metabolic engineering. In May 2021, I graduated with Latin and departmental honors from Tulane University in New Orleans. At Tulane, I double majored in mathematics and computer science with a management minor. I am excited about research at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and biology.

I have been in collaboration with Prof. Scott McKinley (Tulane University) and Prof. Christine Payne (Duke University) to develop a statistical dashboard to automatically categorize diverse particle movement patterns in live-cell data. I completed a Mathematics Honors Thesis and a Computer Science Capstone to expand upon this work. 

I also collaborated with Prof. Veronica Ciocanel (Duke University), Prof. Adriana Dawes (Ohio State University), and Prof. Scott McKinley (Tulane University) on topological data analysis approaches for uncovering the timing of ring structure onset in filamentous networks.

In my free time, I enjoy playing jazz and classical guitar and completing escape rooms.
